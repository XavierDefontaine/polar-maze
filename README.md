# Polar Maze

~~Use numpy array as the basis~~\
~~Try to move from top-left to bottom-right~~\
Create render game\
Guard clause to not go over the edge of the board\
Then think about adding a blocker (later think about adding multiple blockers)
- find some way to ensure there is always an open path

Add way points

## Error messages to look into:
```
polar_maze.py:61: 
FutureWarning: Using a non-tuple sequence for multidimensional indexing is deprecated; use `arr[tuple(seq)]` instead of `arr[seq]`. In the future this will be interpreted as an array index, `arr[np.array(seq)]`, which will result either in an error or a different result.
```
